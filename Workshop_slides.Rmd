# ...like a book

Think about packages like a book.

To use the information in a book, first you must buy the book (install.package("package_name")), then you have to open it up every time you want to reference anything in it (library(package_name)).

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

# Planning Your Analysis and Working Paper

---
# Directories & Projects

A directory in RStudio is the default location where R will look for your files and save your scripts.  

You can define a working directory to keep all of your files and scripts together in a folder on your computer (in the same way you'd set up a folder to keep related documents together).

Projects are associated with working directories. When you start a new project in RStudio and define it's path, that becomes your working directory for the project where RStudio will look for and save your files.

 
### _Activity: Set up a new project_

# R Script

.pull-left[
### Benefits
- Miminal set up

- Can be 'called' and reused modularly

- Simple
]

.pull-right[
### Challenges
- All integrated documentation is through #commenting

- Requires re-running each time to see output

]
---
# R Markdown

.pull-left[
### Benefits
- Commentary, code, and results are integrated into a single document

- Output can be in .pdf, .html, or .doc 

- Can create a fully comprehensive working paper
]

.pull-right[
### Challenges
- Requires some additional planning and set up

- Additional learning curve working with code chunks to ensure the desired output

- Requires some additional troubleshooting for errors and technical problems 'knitting' documents 
]

### _Activity: Create a a new R Markdown document, and a new script in your project_

Helpful hint: When closing your scripts, save your scripts but **DO NOT SAVE** the workspace.
---
# Work Structure & Sequencing
  - **Sequential processing:** Your code will run in the sequence it is written.

  - **Comments:** Add comments to your code by using #
  
  - **Script headers:** Best practice is to include a script header on your R scripts. Rmarkdown documents may not need an explanatory header depending on the design of the working paper.
  
  - **Snippets:** You can custom design snippets (little pieces of code or comments) to support consistency in your scripts. These are great shortcuts for script headers and script sections.

  - **Libraries:** Best practice is to include your libraries at the beginning of your code - but this is not required.

### _Activity: Format your R Script_
- Set up a header snippet
- Insert a header
- Install and call libraries

# Built-in Datasets

- Base R has a number of built in datasets.

- Additionally, almost all packages come with built in datasets.

- Often the online help for using functions is demonstrated on these built in datasets so that you can reproduce the same demo in your own script and get identical results.

- Built-in data has typically be cleansed and is tidy.
---
class:  center, middle
### *Activity: List the Built-in Datasets & Call a Few to Explore*

```{r eval=FALSE}
data()

Titanic
iris
mtcars
```

---
# Data Structures and Types

.pull-left[
**Structures:**
- **vector**: a sequence of data elements of the same basic type
- **data frame**: a table or 2 dimensional array-like structure
- **factor**: a variable used to categorize data with a limited number of values
- **list**: objects that contain elements of different types
- **matrix**: 2 dimensional, homogenous data structure. Single data type
]
.pull-right[
**Types:**
- character
- numeric
- integer
- logical
- complex
]

Objects may have attributes such as name, dimension, and class
---
class: center, middle
### *Activity: Read in and explore a built-in dataset*
```{r}
iris <- iris
```
---
# Vectors and Variables

The assignment function: <- or -> (shortcut is Alt + _ )

Using the assignment function creates named objects in your environment that you can use in your code.

### *Activity: Create variables and vectors*

```{r}

today <- Sys.Date()

months <- 12

total <- c(6,45,21,34,643,11,865)

```
---
# Operators

<img src="img/operators.png" height= 200>

### *Activity: Complete a calculation to create a variable*

```{r}
amount <- 12+4

x <-  months * total

```
---
# Functions
Functions automate common tasks and calculations.

*hint: Cheatsheet as a help resource (see RStudio Help menu for a drop down option)*

Common Functions:
```{r eval=FALSE}

sum() #add
mean() #average
min() #minimum value
max() #maximum value
n() #count of values


select() #chooses which columns
filter() #chooses which rows
mutate() #creates and modifies columns
group_by() #groups together for summarizing
summarize() #summarizes based on groups

```
---
# Piping

The pipe (%>%) operator allows you to string a series of functions together into a code block.

%>% is the equivalent of saying "...and then do..." between instructions.

Shortcut is Cntl+Shift+m

```{r}
iris %>% 
  select(Species, Petal.Width) %>% 
  filter(Species == "setosa") %>% 
  slice_sample(n=10)
  

```
---
# Grouping and Summarizing

Grouping and summarizing data in categories is often required.

If the intent is to visualize the data, save the output as an object.

```{r}
(iris %>% 
  group_by(Species) %>% 
  summarize(Total=n(),
            Mean=mean(Petal.Width)) ->species_summary)

```

# Visualization
<img src="img/ggplot2.svg" height= 500>

---
# Key Components

### Every ggplot2 plot has 3 key components

1.  Data

1.  Aesthetic mappings between variables inthe data and visual properties

1.  At least one layer describing how to render each observation (usually with a geom function)
---
# Activity: Create graphs
Create a point graph using the mpg dataset
```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=5 }
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point()

```
---
Create a histogram
```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=5}
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5)
```
---
Create a barplot

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=5}
ggplot(mpg, aes(manufacturer)) + 
  geom_bar()
```

---
# Customizing visualizations
- colour / fill
- facet
- labels
- size
- shapes
- themes
---
# Layered demo

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

ggplot(data=iris, aes(Sepal.Length, y=Sepal.Width, color=Species)) + 
  geom_point(aes(shape=Species), size=1.5) + 
  geom_smooth(method="lm") +
  xlab("Sepal Length") + 
  ylab("Sepal Width") + 
  ggtitle("Faceting")+
  facet_grid(. ~ Species)->faceted

```
---
```{r fig.width=9, fig.height=7, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
faceted

# Reshaping Datasets, Dates, & Strings
<img src="img/lubridate.svg" height= 300>
<img src="img/stringr.svg" height= 300>
---
# Pivoting

Often operational data is not in a tidy format and needs to be reshaped before it can be more easily used.

Example:
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
(data <- read_csv("untidy_data.csv"))

```
---
### Pivot Longer

```{r}
data %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols=c(-...1), 
               names_to = "Year", 
               values_to = "Values")

```
---
### Dates

If a date column isn't automatically recognized, a character or numeric column will need to be converted to a date format.


```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(lubridate)

(sample_sick_data <- read_csv("sample_sick_data.csv"))
```
---
**Replace the full event date with just the year **
```{r}
sample_sick_data %>% 
  mutate(`Event Date`= year(`Event Date`))

```

---
### Strings

Filter for values that contain a specific string
```{r}
sample_sick_data %>% 
  filter(str_detect(`Function Category`, "SIE"))

```
